It is a package that pulls data from spotifiy’s API (https://www.rcharlie.com/spotifyr/). The data has several variables such as: track_id, track_name, track_artist, track_popularity, and       track_album_id. 
                    The data is from Spotify. Spotify is a digital music streaming platform that offers millions of songs, podcasts, and other audio content. Spotify is offered across various platforms such as IOS and Android.  
                    My approach to the data has several components.

        <div id="problem">     
            <h2 style="background-color: #1ED760;">Project Section 3: Defining the problem</h2>

            The problem definition is “How can Spotify improve the profit margins of their core business which is their digital music streaming services?” My business question definition is “How can we get consumers to listen to more songs and longer?” The problem's relevance is that Spotify has never been profitable for an entire fiscal year in its history. A company can only remain unprofitable for so long. It is crucial that Spotify find a path toward profitability. Analyzing Spotify’s user data is crucial as users are the main source of revenue for Spotify. By improving customer experience and retention, Spotify can improve its profit margins. Prioritizing data-driven insights will create a pathway toward sustainable profitability within its core music streaming business. 
            The profitability challenge is not merely a financial problem; it is integral to Spotify's ability to innovate, invest in content acquisition, and expand its market share against competitors. Moreover, as the digital streaming landscape evolves with new entrants and changing consumer preferences, Spotify must adapt to remain relevant. Analyzing user data isn't just about understanding current behaviors; it is about anticipating future trends and evolving alongside user demands. By prioritizing data-driven insights and refining its platform to better serve user needs, Spotify can secure its position as a market leader and pave the way for sustainable profitability in an ever-changing digital music landscape.

<p>I looked at several things for my exploratory data analysis. I first created a heatmap to find some correlations.

<pre><code class="language-python">
selected_columns = ['track_popularity', 
                    'danceability',
                    'energy',
                    'loudness',
                    'speechiness',
                    'acousticness',
                    'instrumentalness',
                    'liveness', 
                    'valence', 
                    'tempo', 
                    'duration_ms'
                   ]

df_set = df[selected_columns]

plt.figure(figsize=(16, 8))
sns.set(style="whitegrid")
sns.heatmap(df_set.corr(),annot=True, cmap='YlGnBu')</code></pre>
                



<img src="images/1716086704775.png", width="100%"/>

<p> I then looked for relationships for my qualitative variables like track_artists and track_name. I also looked at correlations for others variableslike genre and track popularity, but there was not much correlation. 
I also looked at the summary statistics. Analyzing the summary statistics did not offer any noticeable patterns given the nature of my data.</p>

<img src="images/describe.png", width="100%", height="100%" />

<p>This data set is right for my business question. The data is derived directly from Spotify’s own API and the user that uploaded the data is a highly regarded member of the Kaggle community. With over 30,000 songs, this is a big enough data set to analyze and draw some analysis.  
    I also looked at duration_ms to see if there was any correlation with track duration and popularity. Looking at the heatmap there was little to no correlation. What was interesting to me however was that the histogram for the data was right skewed. Further analysis demonstrated to me however that this was not meaningful since I had already determined there was little to no correlation between song duration and popularity. 
    </p>

<img src="images/duration.png", width="100%">

<p>Another thing I decided to explore was the frequency of certain words. Words in tracks, genres, artists, album id, playlist_name, and album names. I did not find it particularly insightful. Most of the high frequency words were words like “the”, “you”, “me”, etc. Playlist name however did yield some insight which led to exploring the relationship more in PowerBI.

<img src="images/wordcloud2.png", width="100%">


<p>Here is the chart I analyzed in PowerBI when it comes to track popularity by playlist name.</p>

        <div id="analysis">   
                <h2 style= "background-color: #1ED760;">Project Section 5: Analysis</h2></div>

<p>	The outcome variable for my analysis is track_popularity. For my analysis I decided to look at what variables could affect track popularity. 
    I conducted most of my analysis using Python. I used several libraries:

    <pre><code class="language-python">import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from ydata_profiling import ProfileReport
from collections import Counter</pre></code>




    </p>

<p>I  cleaned the data using:
    <pre><code class="language-python">df.isnull().sum()</pre></code> 
 
    <p>This drops all null values from the data. </p>
    
    I then dropped all the zeros from track_popularity as I found it was skewing my data. 
    
    
    <pre><code class="language-python">df = df[df['track_popularity'] != 0] .</pre></code> 
 
    
    From here I exported the data into a CSV file for further analysis in PowerBI:
    
    
    <pre><code class="language-python">df.to_csv('cleanedspotify.csv') </pre></code> 
    

<p>For the first portion of my analysis, I first created a heatmap of the data to figure out which variables may be useful to look at that could be useful in answering the business question: 
</p>


<img src="images/1716086704775.png", width="100%">

<p>
Looking the the heatmap I saw that energy and loudness have some correlation. I also saw dancebility and valence, and accousticness and energy. I created several scatterplots to look for correlations in my data.</p>

<P>A correlation of 0.68 is considered a strong positive correlation. We can also visually see this as most of the data is near each other in a linear line indicating that there is a positive correlation.</p>



<p>I then looked at danceability and valence:</p>
<pre><code class= "language-python">correlation_coefficient = df_set['danceability'].corr(df_set['valence'])

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.scatterplot(data=df_set, x='danceability', y='valence', hue='track_popularity')
plt.title(f'Scatterplot of Danceability vs. Valence (Correlation Coefficient: {correlation_coefficient:.2f})')
plt.xlabel('Danceability')
plt.ylabel('Valence')
plt.show()
</pre></code>

<img src="images/scatterplot2.png", width="100%">

<p>Here we can see that the data have as correlation of 0.33 which means that there is little to no correlation. We can visually see this as the data points are scattered everywhere.</p>


<p>The variables that I decided to look at next were energy and acousticness:</p>

<pre><code class= "language-python">correlation_coefficient = df_set['energy'].corr(df_set['acousticness'])

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.scatterplot(data=df_set, x='energy', y='acousticness', hue='track_popularity')
plt.text(0.05, 0.97, f'Correlation Coefficient: {correlation_coefficient:.2f}', transform=plt.gca().transAxes)
plt.xlabel('Energy')
plt.ylabel('Acousticness')
plt.show()

<img src="images/scatterplot3.png", width="100%">

<p>The data have as correlation of -0.54 which means that there is little to no correlation. We can visually see this as the data points are scattered everywhere.</p>





<P>Looking at the correlations in the heatmap did not give me a clear view of the data. Quantitative analysis did not yield as much insight as I thought it would. I decided to analyze the qualitative data. This led to me to create a chart for track_name and popularity:</P>
<pre><code class= "language-python">plt.figure(figsize=(40, 30))
sns.set(style="whitegrid")
    
x = df.groupby("track_name")["track_popularity"].mean().sort_values(ascending=False).head(10)
axis = sns.barplot(x=x.index, y=x)
    
axis.set_ylabel('Popularity', fontsize=40)
axis.set_xlabel('song title', fontsize=40)
axis.tick_params(labelsize=20)  </pre></code>

<img src="images/bargraph1.png", width="100%">

<p>I then created a bar chart for track_artist and track_popularity:
</p>
<pre><code class= "language-python">from collections import Counter
    ​
artist_popularity_sum = Counter()
    ​
    ​
for l in df[["track_artist", "track_popularity"]].to_numpy():
    artist_list = [x.strip() for x in l[0].split(',')]
    for artist in artist_list:
     artist_popularity_sum[artist] += float(l[1])
    ​
#split separates artists names
#strip gets rid of spaces
#popularity add points to an artist
    ​
    ​
top_10_artist = artist_popularity_sum.most_common(10)
xs = [a[0] for a in top_10_artist]
ys = [a[1] for a in top_10_artist]
    ​
plt.figure(figsize=(20, 10))
sns.set(style="whitegrid")
axis = sns.barplot(x=xs, y=ys)
    ​
axis.set_ylabel('Popularity')
axis.set_xlabel('artist')
</pre></code>

<img src="images/bargraph2.png", width="100%">

<P>I then looked at genre and sum genre in PowerBI.</P>


<img src="images/powerbi1.png", width="100%">

<p>I first looked at the averages of track_artists and playlist_genre and their popularity score(0-100). This gave me insight into which artists had the highest ratings, but this did not give me a full picture of the data as this only tells me their ratings on average not how popular they are. If an artist has 1 song with a rating of 100 but the song has only been listened to 10 times is that actually a popular song? This made me look toward using sum to get a better estimate of an artist’s popularity and genre popularity. The sum gives a much better picture toward a genre’s overall popularity and an Artist’s overall popularity. </p>
