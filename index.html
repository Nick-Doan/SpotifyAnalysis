                <p>     The data is called “30000 Spotify Songs” on Kaggle. It was uploaded by Joakim Arvidsson, a Grand Master on Kaggle. The data comes from Spotify via the spotifyr package. It is a package that pulls data from spotifiy’s API (https://www.rcharlie.com/spotifyr/). The data has several variables such as: track_id, track_name, track_artist, track_popularity, and       track_album_id. 
                    The data is from Spotify. Spotify is a digital music streaming platform that offers millions of songs, podcasts, and other audio content. Spotify is offered across various platforms such as IOS and Android.  
                    My approach to the data has several components. The first is asking the question, “How can we get consumers to listen to more songs?” According to Invespodia, 95% of Spotify’s revenue comes from premium subscriptions (How Spotify Makes Money: Premium Services and Ad-Supported Services). A big part of why people pay for Spotify is for the ad-free experience, unlimited skips, personalized playlists, etc (The Consumer Decision Journey Report | Spotify Ads). Given this research we know that the more that we can get people to listen to music on the platform, the more likely they are to 1.) listen to music with ad-support or 2.) pay for a premium account. The second step of analyzing the data is to do exploratory data analysis. To find patterns and trends in the data that will help support Spotify take actionable steps to answer the business question I proposed.  The third step will to do formal modeling. Fourth interpretation. Fifth communication.

        <div id="problem">     
            <h2>Project Section 3: Defining the problem</h2>

            The problem definition is “How can Spotify improve the profit margins of their core business which is their digital music streaming services?” My business question definition is “How can we get consumers to listen to more songs and longer?” The problem's relevance is that Spotify has never been profitable for an entire fiscal year in its history. A company can only remain unprofitable for so long. It is crucial that Spotify find a path toward profitability. Analyzing Spotify’s user data is crucial as users are the main source of revenue for Spotify. By improving customer experience and retention, Spotify can improve its profit margins. Prioritizing data-driven insights will create a pathway toward sustainable profitability within its core music streaming business. 
            The profitability challenge is not merely a financial problem; it is integral to Spotify's ability to innovate, invest in content acquisition, and expand its market share against competitors. Moreover, as the digital streaming landscape evolves with new entrants and changing consumer preferences, Spotify must adapt to remain relevant. Analyzing user data isn't just about understanding current behaviors; it is about anticipating future trends and evolving alongside user demands. By prioritizing data-driven insights and refining its platform to better serve user needs, Spotify can secure its position as a market leader and pave the way for sustainable profitability in an ever-changing digital music landscape.

<p>I looked at several things for my exploratory data analysis. I first created a heatmap to find some correlations. 
</p>


<pre><code class="language-python">
selected_columns = ['track_popularity', 
                    'danceability',
                    'energy',
                    'loudness',
                    'speechiness',
                    'acousticness',
                    'instrumentalness',
                    'liveness', 
                    'valence', 
                    'tempo', 
                    'duration_ms'
                   ]

df_set = df[selected_columns]

plt.figure(figsize=(16, 8))
sns.set(style="whitegrid")
sns.heatmap(df_set.corr(),annot=True, cmap='YlGnBu')</code></pre>
                



<img src="images/1716086704775.png" />

<p> I then looked for relationships for my qualitative variables like track_artists and track_name. I also looked at correlations for others variableslike genre and track popularity, but there was not much correlation. 
I also looked at the summary statistics. Analyzing the summary statistics did not offer any noticeable patterns given the nature of my data.</p>

<img src="images/describe.png", width="1150", height="400" />

<p>This data set is right for my business question. The data is derived directly from Spotify’s own API and the user that uploaded the data is a highly regarded member of the Kaggle community. With over 30,000 songs, this is a big enough data set to analyze and draw some analysis.  
    I also looked at duration_ms to see if there was any correlation with track duration and popularity. Looking at the heatmap there was little to no correlation. What was interesting to me however was that the histogram for the data was right skewed. Further analysis demonstrated to me however that this was not meaningful since I had already determined there was little to no correlation between song duration and popularity. 
    </p>

<img src="images/duration.png", width="1160">

<p>Another thing I decided to explore was the frequency of certain words. Words in tracks, genres, artists, album id, playlist_name, and album names. I did not find it particularly insightful. Most of the high frequency words were words like “the”, “you”, “me”, etc. Playlist name however did yield some insight which led to exploring the relationship more in PowerBI. 
</p>

<img src="images/wordlcoud1.png">

<img src="images/wordcloud2.png">


<p>Here is the chart I analyzed in PowerBI when it comes to track popularity by playlist name.</p>

<img src="images/popularity and track.png", width="1150">





        <div id="analysis">   
                <h2>Project Section 5: Analysis</h2></div>

<p>	The outcome variable for my analysis is track_popularity. For my analysis I decided to look at what variables could affect track popularity. 
    I conducted most of my analysis using Python. I used several libraries:

    <pre><code class="language-python">
        import numpy as np
        import pandas as pd
        import seaborn as sns
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        from ydata_profiling import ProfileReport
        from collections import Counter
    </pre></code>




    </p>

<p>I  cleaned the data using:
    <pre><code class="language-python">df.isnull().sum()</pre></code> 
 
    <p>This drops all null values from the data. </p>
    
    I then dropped all the zeros from track_popularity as I found it was skewing my data. 
    
    
    <pre><code class="language-python">df = df[df['track_popularity'] != 0] .</pre></code> 
 
    
    From here I exported the data into a CSV file for further analysis in PowerBI:
    
    
    <pre><code class="language-python">df.to_csv('cleanedspotify.csv') </pre></code> 
    

<p>For the first portion of my analysis, I first created a heatmap of the data to figure out which variables may be useful to look at that could be useful in answering the business question: 
</p>


<img src="images/1716086704775.png">

<p>
Looking the the heatmap I saw that energy and loudness have some correlation. I also saw dancebility and valence, and accousticness and energy. I created several scatterplots to look for correlations in my data.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">correlation_coefficient = df_set['energy'].corr(df_set['loudness'])
sns.scatterplot(data= df_set, x= 'energy', y='loudness', hue='track_popularity')
plt.text(0.05, 0.95, f'Correlation Coefficient: {correlation_coefficient:.2f}', transform=plt.gca().transAxes)
</pre></code> 

<img src="images/scatterplot1.png">


<P>A correlation of 0.68 is considered a strong positive correlation. We can also visually see this as most of the data is near each other in a linear line indicating that there is a positive correlation.</p>
